# 🛒 Shopping List App

A sleek and interactive shopping list application built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**. It allows users to add, update, delete and filter items from the list with support for **light/dark** themes. The application uses **local storage**, so the list remains available even after a page refresh.
